   TAATTA: Z-score, Significance: 2.6, 0.005
   ATTAAT: Z-score, Significance: 2.5, 0.01
   TTAATT: Z-score, Significance: 2.0, 0.05
   AATTTA: Z-score, Significance: 2.2, 0.05

b. yes, they correspond the same masks, partially overlap and the first two kmers are palindromic kmers. 
c. -
d. many
e. Number of promoters with Enriched Transcription Factors sites < 10^(-3). It is less then number of promoters with Non-enriched TF sites. And this motif are long.
f. Yes, ATTAATTA and there are a lot of equal distances between occurrences of this motifs.
g. MA0005.2, MA0548.1
h. -
i. No, the first method more sensitive. Z-score is the signed number of standard deviations an observation or datum is above the mean. For specific motifs z-score are positive and big. 
j. yes
k. 93.5933333333333
l. First motif is very conservative.
m. no
