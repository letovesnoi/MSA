a - NCBI, SMART, Pfam, COGs, TIGRFAM, PRK, KOGs, LOAD
b - 3419 amino acids
c - BRCA2 protein possess 5 distinct protein domains.
d - BRCA2 posses 8 repeat domains
e - 10
f - yes, function of these domains could be independently of one another because there are a lot of species who have one domain and have not another
g - no
h - BRCA2 possess 6 regions of low complexity
i - 5 distinct protein domains: BRCA2, BRCA-2_helical, BRCA-2_OB1, Tower, BRCA-2_OB3
j - yes
k - there are a lot of different species and BRC repeat may not necessarily mean cancer
l - 8
m - hmmbuild -o /dev/null HMM SEED
n - yes, the results of InterProScan congruent with the CDD search
