This repository was created when I took the Molecular sequence analysis course on Algorithmic Bioinformatics core program.

This course is given at the Bioinformatics Institute which offers additional education based on the Academic University of Russian Academy of Sciences, SPb.

The authors of this course is Andrey D. Prjibelski and Irina Vasilinetc.

Enter Bioinformatics Institute too and let's solve these problems!
